I'm nervous, so nervous
I overeat
I lack a purpose
And I'm only scratching the surface
And I'm not shelved
'Cause sex sells
But how long 'til I'm cancelled
This is 30, fucking 30
I'm still here
I'm still dirty
I made it, I'm a flower
I don't sleep, I don't shower
I masturbate twice every hour (haha, that's fucking disgusting)
And my band's sick
'Cause my head's sick (yeah, okay)
I get drunk and I'm reckless
Stalk my Twitter, stan my bullshit
This is 30
Something is wrong with me
Ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hahahahaha
So raise up your glasses to going out of fashion
To acronyms, sex cams and social distractions
'Cause everything's changing, and I don't know shit about shit
I'm older, I've got wrinkles
I still complain, I get pimples
I miss when everything was simple
The sex passed too fast
I ask, how long did your ex last?
I'm fucking worthless
I'm unhappy
This is 30
Yeah!
Ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So get off your asses and take down the masses
Socialists, fascists, the world is all plastic
'Cause everyone fakes it
But they don't know shit about shit
You treat me like a baby
Forgive me when I'm wrong
You love me when I'm crazy
I'm alright, but I hate that song
You treat me like a baby
Forgive me when I'm wrong
You love me when I'm crazy
You know my only wish is for a better life
Don't treat me like a baby
And fight me when I'm wrong
Slap me when I'm crazy
I'm alright, but I hate that song
